                <h2>Show Low Arizona</h2>
                <p>A small town nested in the Arizona white mountains. A beautiful town with the environment
                the locals called "the high desert". Judging by the sheer size of the town,
                you may think there is not much to do but you would be wrong. If you love hiking
                and seeing pre-historic sites, this is the place for you! You will have to do 
                some driving to see these magnificent sites but it is definitely worth it!
                </p>

                <h2>Eureka Springs Arkansas</h2>
                <p>Just a 5 hour drive south from my hometown of Saint Charles is Eureka Springs
                Arkansas. Never heard of such a place until a friend of mine posted pictures 
                of the town on Facebook. After seeing how beautiful it was, I had to see it for
                myself. The town had me in awe. It was like taking a trip back into time. 
                The Native inhabitants claimed the area had healing springs which resulted in 
                settlers flocking to the area to be healed. It is now a tourist destination.  
                All of the buildings have been restored from the early 1900's with keeping 
                the victorian style in mind. Every house, building and hotel had it's own 
                unique charm. I was shocked I didn't know such a place existed. They have 
                festivals every weekend suited for anyones' liking. If you happen to find yourself
                there, I <b>highly </b>recommend doing their <a href="http://www.eurekatrolley.org/">Trolley tour</a>.
                There's many more things to see in Eureka Springs but never enough time! A little more information on Eureka 
                Springs.

                <h2>Tom Sauk Mountain</h2>
                <p>This area has a lot of History. I mainly went here for the hiking of Tom Sauk 
     mountain and found a surprise in the process. The beautiful Mina Sauk falls.
     A mile and a half hike or so on the Tom Sauk trail will bring you to Mina Falls.
     There's a lot of rock climbing so watch your step and bring plenty of water. 
     You can also do a 13 mile hike down to Johnson shut-ins.

                <h2>Alley Springs</h2>
                <p>If you love going on float trips and are a seasoned floater, you need to
                make a trip down to Alley Springs. The Jacks fork river is stunning and 
                can be treacherous at times. 
                The river is fed by springs giving it a gorgeous crystal blue color.
                The water is also very refreshing during a hot summer day. You will see
                Great Blue herons, King Fishers and all types of turtles hanging out on 
                the banks of the Jacks fork. I even saw several Bald Eagles circling above 
                the tree line. I highly recommend to float during the week when there 
                far less floaters on the water.  
                </p>
